To host a server with this map, you have the follow the same steps form the [Installing](#installing) section. The unique thing you have to guarantee is that all of the players did the installation in their environment, with the same folder name (`LEVEL140`), otherwise, they will not be able to play in the server.

If you want to contribute for this project, or you want to use the map as base for your project, check the steps bellow to know how to edit the map on CE. I recommend the usage of [Cehub](https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/CEHub) to edit the map, since it already has the support to start editing it easily.

1. Open [Cehub](https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/CEHub) >= v1.2.0;
2. Create a new instance of type `Map Editor`;
3. After setup the instance, open the instance folder and open `/level128` folder;
4. Replace the file `World.dat` by the same file from this repository;
5. Run the instance from Cehub and start editing!
